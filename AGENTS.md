# Harness Repository Agent Guide

## Purpose

This repository packages the local agent harness for a Docker-backed `wiki-manager` MCP server. It does not own wiki content or the core indexing service. It owns the installer, generated repository assets, the managed `$wiki` skill, MCP/editor configuration templates, wrapper scripts, package documentation, and verification harness.

This `AGENTS.md` is for agents working on this harness repository only. It is not installed into consumer repositories. Consumer-facing agent policy lives at `templates/root/AGENTS.md`.

## Repository Map

- `bin/harness.js`: install/update/status/doctor CLI. It copies the managed payload, rewrites runner directory references, preserves user-added skills, removes legacy split skills, writes `.harness-install.json`, and reports local install health.
- `templates/root/`: source of files installed into consumer repositories.
- `templates/root/AGENTS.md`: generated consumer repository agent policy.
- `templates/root/.agents/skills/wiki/SKILL.md`: managed `$wiki` workflow delivered to consumers.
- `templates/root/.agents/run-wiki-manager.mcp.js`: Docker-backed MCP runner entrypoint delivered to consumers.
- `templates/root/.claude`, `templates/root/.codex`, `templates/root/.vscode`, `templates/root/opencode.json`: editor and agent MCP configuration templates.
- `templates/root/wiki/.gitkeep`: creates the consumer-owned wiki directory; do not add template wiki content casually.
- `scripts/verify.js`: smoke verification for install/update/status behavior, custom `--agents-dir`, generated MCP references, install marker metadata, and `npm pack --dry-run`.
- `.artifacts/`: generated verification output. Treat as disposable and do not edit source behavior there.
- Root `.agents/`: local workspace directory only when present. It is not the canonical packaged payload.

## Change Boundaries

Keep root-local and consumer-delivered guidance separate:

- Edit this file for harness contributor/agent operating rules.
- Edit `templates/root/AGENTS.md` for policy that should be installed into consumer repositories.
- Edit `templates/root/.agents/skills/wiki/SKILL.md` for the consumer `$wiki` workflow mechanics.
- Edit `README.md` when package behavior, install/update semantics, delivered guidance, or verification expectations change.

Do not make behavior changes only in generated `.artifacts` output. Make changes in `templates/root`, `bin/`, or `scripts/`, then verify.

Do not add consumer wiki notes to this package unless the package intentionally starts shipping starter wiki content. The current contract is that wiki content is consumer-owned.

## Installer Rules

Preserve the installer contract:

- Install/update must preserve user-added skill directories under `<agentsDir>/skills`.
- The managed wiki skill is replaceable by the harness.
- Legacy split skills are intentionally removed: `retrieve-knowledge`, `initialize-wiki`, `migrate-wiki`, and `wiki-maintenance`.
- Root assets are overwritten only with `--force`.
- `--agents-dir` must remain a portable direct-child directory name that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- MCP config references must be rewritten when `--agents-dir` is custom.
- The runner directory must remain a direct child of the consumer repository because the MCP runner resolves its parent as the project root.

When changing copy/rewrite logic, check both default `.agents` installs and custom `--agents-dir` installs.

## Template Rules

Treat `templates/root` as an installable product surface:

- Keep delivered instructions concise, professional, and implementation-neutral.
- Avoid repository-specific assumptions from this harness repo in consumer templates.
- Keep workflow mechanics in the `$wiki` skill and durable consumer policy in `templates/root/AGENTS.md`.
- Keep installed `.agents/README.md` short and consumer-facing.
- Keep path examples portable where practical; include Windows and POSIX command variants when users need both.
- Avoid absolute local paths in README examples, delivered templates, and wiki guidance. Consumer repositories may be cloned into different locations, so committed guidance should use repository-relative paths.
- Do not create placeholder notes, broad topic inventories, or unimplemented wiki workflows in templates.

When adding or renaming delivered files, update installer behavior, verification, README layout documentation, and package contents as needed.

## Documentation Standards

The README is package documentation. It should describe what the harness installs, how update behavior works, how verification works, and how consumers should refresh committed harness files.

Keep terminology consistent across:

- `README.md`
- `templates/root/AGENTS.md`
- `templates/root/.agents/skills/wiki/SKILL.md`

For wiki guidance, prefer professional architecture terms such as governed knowledge workflow, retrieval gate, typed notes, capability specifications, quality attributes, traceability, and reconstruction guidance. Avoid casual or session-specific phrasing.

## Verification

Run `npm run verify` before considering harness changes complete. It exercises the installer against scratch repositories and runs `npm pack --dry-run`.

Verification is especially required after changes to:

- `bin/harness.js`
- `scripts/verify.js`
- anything under `templates/root`
- `package.json`
- package README sections that describe install/update/packaged behavior

If verification fails, fix the source files rather than patching generated scratch output under `.artifacts`.

## Packaging

The npm package includes only paths declared in `package.json` `files`: `bin/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, and `README.md`. Root `AGENTS.md` is intentionally not packaged or installed into consumer repositories.

Before publishing or asking users to install from GitHub, make sure the relevant changes are committed and pushed. Consumers installing with `npx github:ihorleleka/harness ...` get the GitHub ref, not uncommitted local files.

## Coding Standards

- Keep the Node CLI dependency-free unless there is a strong reason to add package dependencies.
- Prefer standard `fs`, `path`, and `child_process` APIs for installer behavior.
- Preserve cross-platform path handling. Test Windows path cases mentally even when editing on another platform.
- Avoid shell-specific assumptions in generated scripts and README commands.
- Keep destructive filesystem operations scoped to known target directories. Do not remove arbitrary consumer paths.
- Keep installer errors actionable and specific.
- Update verification when adding behavior that can regress.

## Git and Generated Output

The worktree may contain user changes. Do not revert changes you did not make.

Ignore `.artifacts/` unless inspecting verification output. It is generated by smoke tests and ignored by git.

When reviewing diffs, pay special attention to whether a change affects:

- consumer root assets;
- managed `.agents` payload;
- custom `--agents-dir` rewriting;
- root overwrite behavior with and without `--force`;
- package contents.

## Wiki Status For This Repo

This harness repository does not currently rely on its own `wiki/` content. For normal harness changes, report `Wiki: no update needed - harness guidance/package code changed` unless an actual repository wiki is introduced later.
