# Wiki Authoring Reference

Load this reference only for Initialize, Migrate, or non-trivial Maintain work.

## Specificity And Generalization

Choose the target before drafting:

- **Harness-generic:** reusable across unrelated repositories; exclude consumer
  names, domain wording, frameworks, and incidental paths.
- **Project-wide:** a repository invariant independent of the task that exposed it.
- **Capability-specific:** exact behavior owned by one feature, component,
  integration, API, or workflow; preserve public labels and contract terms.
- **Instance evidence:** a bug, task, file, or example supporting a claim, not a rule by itself.

Extract the invariant, name its scope/non-goals, and test it against a materially
different scenario. Narrow it or keep it as evidence when it does not generalize.

## Note Scope And Size

One note should own one retrievable capability, component, contract,
integration, decision, rule, runbook, glossary area, or cross-cutting concern.

- Target under 150 lines/1,500 words for focused notes.
- Split before `KB_NOTE_MAX_LINES` (default 200), more than eight top-level
  sections, or `KB_EVIDENCE_MAX_ANCHORS` (default 12) when cohesion is weakening.
- Split when different searches need unrelated sections, evidence dominates,
  kinds are mixed, or one packet cannot answer a routine owner query coherently.
- Keep a short parent map responsible for summary, boundaries, links, and hints.

## Typed Notes

Frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: stable-note-id
kind: reference
scope: project-specific
last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD
status: active
applies_to:
  - domain-or-component
---
```

Canonical shapes:

- `rule`: `Use this when`, `Rule`, `Do`, `Do not`, `Evidence`, `Retrieval hints`.
- `decision`: `Use this when`, `Decision`, `Rationale`, `Consequences`, `Evidence`, `Retrieval hints`.
- `reference`: `Use this when`, `Summary`, `Key facts`, `Evidence`, `Retrieval hints`.
- `runbook`: `Use this when`, `Steps`, `Do not`, `Evidence`, `Retrieval hints`.
- `glossary`: `Terms`, `Aliases`, `Retrieval hints`.

Do not flatten mandatory rules into references or mix several kinds to avoid
choosing ownership. Use repository-relative files/directories, public symbols,
focused tests, migrations, tickets, or user confirmations as bounded evidence.

## Capability Specifications

Use an extended `reference` when future agents need to understand or reconstruct
a delivery unit without repeating discovery. Include concrete retrieval
triggers, verified behavior/contracts, boundaries, evidence, verification, and
explicit open questions for partial coverage.

Supported sections include `Capability contract`, `Behavior model`,
`Interaction model`, `Architecture boundaries`, `Data and integration
contracts`, `Quality attributes`, `Acceptance and verification`,
`Reconstruction guidance`, `Evidence`, `Open questions`, and `Retrieval hints`.
Once using the extended shape, include at least `Capability contract`,
`Architecture boundaries`, and `Acceptance and verification`.

Prefer stable owner directories, public symbols, and focused tests over
file-by-file inventories. Repository inspection validates declared anchors;
routine retrieval does not require reopening them all.

## Canonical Homes

Use this as a menu, not a checklist:

- `index.md`: active-note map and routing.
- `overview.md`: repository purpose, runtime, entrypoints, dependencies.
- `architecture.md`: major decisions and consequences.
- `coding-standards.md` or `rules/<topic>.md`: mandatory behavior.
- `development-runbook.md` or `operations/<topic>.md`: repeatable procedures.
- `features/<name>.md`: business/user-facing capabilities.
- `components/<name>.md`: modules, domains, services, reusable components.
- `integrations/<name>.md`: external systems/protocols/adapters.
- `api/<area>.md`, `data/<area>.md`, `ui-patterns.md`, and `glossary.md` for their focused concerns.

## Write-Back Planning

1. Apply repository write-back criteria; stop when nothing durable and verified changed.
2. List distinct durable topics and map each to its smallest authoritative owner.
3. Update existing owners when scope remains cohesive; create a focused owner
   only when useful verified knowledge lacks one.
4. Update every owner whose reusable contract changed. Do not collapse separable
   frontend, backend, API, data, operations, and quality concerns into a broad note.
5. Put useful but unverified behavior in `Open questions` or report it as follow-up.
6. Keep workflow conventions that govern a class of changes in their own owner,
   not hidden only inside one feature incident.

## Change Artifacts And Durable Ownership

Treat proposals, task plans, design drafts, and completed-change archives as
change-oriented artifacts, regardless of which tool or directory owns them.
They explain intent and history but are not automatically authoritative for
current behavior after implementation and verification.

When a change completes or its artifacts are archived, make one explicit
durable-knowledge decision: update the canonical wiki owner, confirm that it
already remains correct, or record that no durable write-back is warranted.
Link to an active artifact only when it remains authoritative; do not duplicate
whole contracts across systems. Reconcile conflicting active claims instead of
requiring future agents to compare both histories manually.
